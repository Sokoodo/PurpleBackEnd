Execution
=========

To run the application, use the following commands:

1. **Run the Flask application:**

   Activate your virtual environment (if not already active), then start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```


3. **Accessing the API:**

   Once the server is running, you can access the API at the specified routes, for example:

   - `POST /api/order-relation/event-log`: Process event log files.
   - `POST /api/custom-noise/event-log`: Generate event logs with custom noise.

   You can use tools like `curl`, Postman, or a web browser to interact with the API.
