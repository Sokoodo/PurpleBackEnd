Introduction
============

PURPLE - Reingeneering of a Purpose-Guided Log Generation Framework.

The first idea of PURPLE came out from a group of researchers from University of
Camerino and Technical University of Denmark.

It is deeply covered in the in the paper “A Purpose-Guided Log Generation
Framework”.

PURPLE is a framework designed to simulate models for producing event logs
with different properties that target different mining purposes.

One of the core aspects is the simulation of models designed in different languages, in particular BPMN and PetriNet.

This simulation is done by projecting their execution onto a common behavioral
model, for instance an LTS.

Key Features
============

PURPLE offers a range of features to facilitate in-depth event log analysis:

- **Customizable Analysis**: Tailor your analysis with various parameters and options.
- **Noise Generation**: Add custom noise to event logs for more robust testing.
- **Detailed Visualization**: Generate detailed visual representations of event logs to gain insights.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other tools and systems for a comprehensive solution.

Use Cases
=========

PURPLE is designed to address a variety of scenarios, including:

- **Process Optimization**: Analyze event logs to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in processes.
- **Quality Assurance**: Test and validate processes by adding controlled noise to event logs.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Ensure that processes adhere to predefined standards and regulations.

These use cases demonstrate how PURPLE can be applied to real-world challenges and provide actionable insights.
